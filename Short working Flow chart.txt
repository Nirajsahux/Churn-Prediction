|--- Data Preprocessing:
|     |
|     |-- Handling Categorical Variables:
|     |      |
|     |      |-- Replace 'No internet service' with 'No' for selected features
|     |      |-- Replace 'No phone service' with 'No' for 'MultipleLines' feature
|     |
|     |-- Handling Special Cases
|     |      |
|     |      |-- Replace special cases in categorical variables
|     |
|     |-- Data Encoding
|     |      |
|     |      |-- Encode categorical variables using LabelEncoder
|     |
|     |-- Handling Missing Values
|   
|--- Data Visualization:
|     |
|     |-- Countplot for 'Churn' distribution
|     |
|     |-- Correlation Matrix Heatmap
|
|--- Feature Scaling and Dimensionality Reduction:
|     |
|     |-- StandardScaler to standardize features
|     |
|     |-- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
|     |
|     |-- Calculation of Explained Variance Ratio
|
|--- Model Training and Evaluation:
|     |
|     |-- SMOTEENN Sampling:
|     |      |
|     |      |-- Resampling of dataset using SMOTEENN to address class imbalance
|     |
|     |-- For each Model:
|     |      |
|     |      |-- Construct Pipeline:
|     |      |       |
|     |      |       |-- Feature Scaling (MinMaxScaler)
|     |      |       |-- Model (e.g., RandomForestClassifier)
|     |      |       |-- Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV)
|     |      |
|     |      |-- Train Pipeline on Resampled Training Data
|     |      |
|     |      |-- Evaluate Pipeline on Resampled Test Data:
|     |               |
|     |               |-- Calculate Accuracy
|     |               |-- Generate Classification Report
|     |               |-- Plot Confusion Matrix
|     |
